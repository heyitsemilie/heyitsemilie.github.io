# Hey I'm Emilie
emilie's corner of the internet 👋 Hi, I’m @heyitsemilie, a sophomore at Yale University.
👀 I’m interested in dancing, jogging and yoga.
🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science and Math, with a bit of Urban Studies thrown in the mix :)
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything, particularly finance.
